                    <p>In 1929, he traveled to London to lobby for Kikuyu land affairs. He studied anthropology under Bronisław Malinowski at the London School of Economics and published his seminal work "Facing Mount Kenya" in 1938.</p>

                    <p>When Kenya became a republic in 1964, Kenyatta became President. His government promoted economic growth through capitalist policies and maintained close ties with the West.</p>
                    <p>He centralized power, suppressed political opposition, and established a de facto one-party state. His leadership saw significant economic development but also increased corruption and ethnic favoritism.</p>

                    <p>Kenyatta is remembered as the "Father of the Nation" who led Kenya to independence. His vision of "Harambee" (pulling together) emphasized national unity and self-reliance.</p>
                    <p>However, his legacy is mixed, with critics pointing to authoritarian tendencies, corruption, and the establishment of a political dynasty.</p>
